# ASR-hybrid-decoding
This is an extension of kaldi speech recognition software which allows to perform decoding of speech with hybrid word and phoneme graphs. The output is a mix of in-vocabulary words and phoneme sequences. This decoding is suitable for systems with only a small dictionary available and for further recovery of OOV words.
